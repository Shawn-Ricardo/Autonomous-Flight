Moving a vehicle from goal to destination is a fundamental problem in autonomous vehicles. There are numerous approaches with new methodologies appearing frequently, especially with the advent of machine learning. This notebook demonstrates how a grid-based global planner paired with a local planner based on random sampling is able to navigate a drone through a simulation of San Francisco. The end of the readme adapts these same principles to a real drone and successfully navigates the drone through a tree line.
